# Brian's EXTension

This is Brian's EXTension.
If you aren't Brian, it's probably not an extension for you.
This extension is published mostly to make it easier
to share with myself.

## Features

Lots of people use vim.
Modal editing is a good idea, and vim has OK keybindings.

But why is `hjkl` sacred? Why not `jkl;`?

Why `0$`? Why not `op`?

Why `Ctrl-U Ctrl-D`? Why not `ui`?

Bext is a modal editor, but with keybindings that *aren't* based on vim.

Instead, I made the keybindings by adding my most common shortcuts to a
blank keyboard layout.
<!-- This lets me throw out vim shortcuts that I rarely used (`123456789qwtp[]\as`), and improve the placement of shortcuts I use often (`i Ctrl-R`) -->
